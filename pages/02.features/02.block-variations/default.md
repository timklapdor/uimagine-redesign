##Block Variations {.entry-title}

<p>Block variations are easy-to-use preset styles that can be applied to any content block. You can do this through the admin by navigating to the particle and/or block's settings in the <strong>Layout Manager</strong>, selecting the <strong>Block</strong> tab, and selecting them within the <strong>Variations</strong> field.</p>
