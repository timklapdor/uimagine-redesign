## About

These sessions provide academics and professional from across CSU to share and show their practice. Ran across the video conferencing system staff from across CSU and remote sites are able to join in, watch the presentations and be involved in the conversation around the topic.

## Program

Topic: Using online technologies to bring together on campus and online students

This forum will include the following presentations:

- Lyn Hay – What the research tells us about blending on campus and online cohorts
- Jane Douglas – Combining online and on campus cohorts in NRS111 Professional Nursing Foundations of Learning
- Anthony Chan – Knowing me, knowing you: Analytics of a mixed cohort of online and internal students in a first year subject
- Phillip Hua – Connected classrooms: Bringing together face-to-face and online students in PSY307 Cognition

### Topic: Online Interaction with the Professions

This Learning Technology Forum will focus on strategies for providing interaction with professionals, professional workplaces, or the professions more broadly for Distance or Online students. The most common way for Online students to engage with the professions is through Workplace Learning placement. This forum focusses on alternative strategies for providing this interaction as well as strategies for connecting students with their peers and lecturers during placement.

### Topic: Engaging Large Online Cohorts

Managing learners for group work within a large online cohort is a challenge u!magine put under the microscope at the April Learning Technology Forum, ‘Engaging large online cohorts’. Presentations provided valuable insight into the structure and design of subjects that have larger cohorts, including challenges and enablers faced by course designers and subject coordinators.

Kylie Murphy and Natalie Hamam, School of Community Health in ‘Enhancing teacher presence and interaction between students through a small group assignment incorporating peer feedback’, discussed pedagogy in a second year subject, HIP202. In this example group membership for an assignment consisted of randomly assigning Distance Education (DE) students (60% of a 180-student cohort) to groups of two and internal students to groups of three through the i2 group discussion board. Group formation was designed around synchronous interactions and collaborations, with two people in a DE group best, given potential issues with time zones. Group work focused on collaboratively generating research questions, conducting research and discussing the value of a research article. Student feedback of this approach to group work was very positive: they enjoyed working in a partnership environment, and learned a lot from group discussions. Additionally, very few groups folded due to unresponsive or unreliable partners.

Amy MacDonald and Paige Lee from the School of Education shared ‘Creating learning communities within sub-cohorts’ in the Bachelor of Teaching, Birth-5 Education course. As an alternative to random allocation or ‘alphabetical’ listings for group creation of marking batches, students were asked to self-enrol in i2 groups/cohorts according to their time/life alignment and needs, with an aim for diversity, not conformity with quality of experiences for students. Having choice for smaller communities afforded students more effective learning cohorts. One learning strategy used was open chat sessions in Adobe Connect so that synchronous and asynchronous chatting could take place across the cohort.

Other presentations included:

- Kristina Gottschall and Kirsten Locke, School of Indigenous Australian Studies, “Creating strong teacher presence through proactive online contact and student responsiveness”
- Miriam Edwards, Ged Bourke and Wendy Webber, DSL and School of Management, “Effective strategies for student engagement in MGT100 aligned with group activity design and assessment”

Group work and collaboration between students continues to be difficult in a competitive academic environment, however examples shared here show that with methodical planning and implementation along with clear learning objectives groups can thrive in both DE and Internal subjects and provide exciting peer-to-peer interactions and learning support.

### Topic: Using Learning Analytics for Student Success

This Learning Technology Forum was joined by Dr Abelardo Pardo from The University of Sydney.

Abelardo is a well-recognised thought leader in Learning Analytics. He specialises in technology enhanced learning with emphasis on learning and behavioural analytics, computer supported collaborative learning, and personalization of learning experiences.

#### Presenters:

- Dr Abelardo Pardo (School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Sydney University) – Analytics Supporting Real World Teaching: Experiences in using Learning Analytics to support flipped classroom designs 
- Simon Welsh (Division of Student Learning, CSU) – It’s All About Context: Considerations in interpreting Learning Analytics for Student Success
- Dr Dan Bedgood (School of Agriculture and Wine Sciences, CSU) – Which Analytics for Student Success? A discussion of how Learning Analytics have been used and evaluated in science subjects
- Stewart McKinney (StudyLink and Division of Student Learning, CSU) – Optimising for Analytics: Setting up a subject site to get the most from Interact2 Analytics

### Topic: Using Interact2 Innovatively

This Learning Technology Forum focussed on examples of innovative use of the tools available in Interact2. Rose and Kellie presented a number of ways in which they helped facilitate increased participation and quality in discussion within a number of subjects. Luke demonstrated how he was using a range of technologies within Interact2 to provide students with more opportunities to engage with him as the teacher and the content. Jonathan illustrated a number of powerful features available in the Rubrics tool to empower markers and provide an improved experience for learners. Finally, Matthew demonstrated his strategies for teaching Hebrew using a graphics tablet and bringing a human touch to the online environment.

#### Presenters:

- Rose Whittingham and Kellie Bousefield – Increasing participation and discussion quality in i2
- Luke Donnan – The online delivery of dermatology to second year podiatry students
- Jonathan Wykes – Utilising the Interact2 Rubrics Tool to Assist in Marking Assessments
- Matthew Anstey – How to use graphics tablets in e-learning for writing and drawing by hand

### Topic: Co-creation of student resources in an online environment

The forum will included a number of really interesting and impressive presentations. Lloyd presented his work on developing resources to support the Wiradjuri learning course. Judy demonstrated the range of work from her student’s portfolios that are publicly on the Thinkspaces environment. Sam demonstrated the rich media works developed by his students. Finally Barbara demonstrated how the authentic assessment tasks completed by her students were actually being implemented in their professions.

#### Presenters:

- Lloyd Dolan – Yalbilinya yabuny galang minyambal-giyalang-dhuradhu or Learning language using clever things.
- Judy O’Connell – Edge learning, embedded design and emergent feedback.
- Sam Bowker – Introducing Online Presentations
- Barbara Combes – Takeaway curriculum: Theory meets practice

### Topic: Using technologies to support cooperative and collaborative learning

This Learning Technology Forum focussed on strategies for supporting cooperative learning in an online context and ways in which technologies can be used to support cooperative learning in an on campus context. To start Lindy provided an overview from the literature around collaborative and cooperative learning. Catherine and Sarah provided a couple of excellent case studies of their successful online learning activities involving peer or small group learning. They discussed  innovative ways of using technologies to support synchronous or asynchronous communication within student group work, strategies for developing online communities to enable collaborative work across a cohort. Franziska’s presentation rounded out the forum by exploring the potential for mobile technology to support these kinds of learning in the workplace context.

#### Presenters:

- Lindy Croft-Piggin – What is the difference between group work and cooperative learning and what are the implications for online learning?
- Catherine Easton with Jane McCormack – Learning academic and professional skills through interaction and collaboration online
- Sarah Hyde with Peter Mills, Yann Guisard and Kerri Hicks – Online problem-based learning as a strategy to enhance learner-learner engagement in distance education
- Franziska Trede with Katelin Sutton – Enhancing workplace learning through mobile technology
