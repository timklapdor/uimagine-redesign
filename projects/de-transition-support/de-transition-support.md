## Description

This project introduced a modularisation of the subject *EML102 Written Communication* in both delivery and assessment in order to meet the transition needs of students commencing the Associate Degree in Adult and Vocational Education. The focus of the subject redevelopment will be on modularising the existing online learning modules and producing a range of multi-modal interactive tasks to develop specific micro-skills. The redevelopment of the subject will also include a review of the current assessment used, with the aim of introducing a number of smaller scaffolded activities that culminate in the production of an academic essay.

## Aims

This aim was to provide effective transition support to students in the Associate Degree in Adult and Vocational Education (ADAVE) through the modularisation and scaffolding of the subject EML102 Written Communication. The proposed project will fund the redevelopment and the trial implementation of this subject for delivery in session 201560. The project will also evaluate the impact of the implementation using a mixed-methodology approach.
