## About

uImagine hosted a think tank exploring *Alternative Staffing Approaches for Scaleable Distance Education*. This event was held on the 15th of September 2015 on the Bathurst Campus of CSU.

The international Experts discussed their institutional staffing approaches with a focus on the roles, responsibilities and employment conditions of online teaching and subject development staff for online and distance learning.

Building upon the CSU DE Strategy, **this Think Tank** was designed to examine best practices by high quality global online institutions and create a dialogue across the CSU academic community about alternative staffing models that strengthen online teaching, student engagement and academic staff support.
