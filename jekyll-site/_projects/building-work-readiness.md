## Description

This project helped the Faculty of Business course/subject teams to enhance students’ workplace readiness through integrating both low­-tech and high­-tech strategies from the ‘simulation triad’ (Wills, 2012) ­ online role play, games and simulations.

The project developed a framework, guidelines and professional learning program, building on current best practice and existing designs/technologies. It identified a number of appropriate subjects within a course context which then prototyped one design in each School. Case studies were be developed to sharpen learning from shared experience, and refine the guidelines and professional development approach.

## Aims

The aims of the project were to:

* Develop a framework and guidelines to support the enhancement of work readiness for business contexts;
* Integrate an online role play, an existing business simulation or game­based elements within an identified subject in each School;
* Support course/subject teams regarding good practice in integrating and teaching with the selected strategies;
* Support students regarding the development of work readiness skills through participation in the selected strategies; and
* Promote good practice in using strategies from the framework through evaluated case studies / prototypes for wider sharing and make recommendations for implementation at scale.

## Approach

The project will adapted Wills’ (2012) Simulation Triad framework to synthesise and extend learning from three recent OLT ­funded projects that explored strategies and tools for providing authentic learning experiences for students.
