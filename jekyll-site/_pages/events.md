### Directions

1. To make the harissa, place chillies in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Soak for 30 minutes then drain. Meanwhile, place coriander, caraway and cumin seeds in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook, tossing, for 1 minute or until aromatic. Use a food processor to finely chop chilli, spices, garlic, coriander and mint. With the motor running, add oil in a thin, steady stream until well incorporated.
2. Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Line an oven tray with baking paper. Place pumpkin and carrot on the tray and drizzle with half the oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables, turning, for 20 minutes or until they are tender.
3. Cook peas in boiling water for 2 minutes or until tender. Heat remaining oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and onion and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until tender. Transfer to a bowl.
4. Add chicken stock to the pan and bring to the boil. Remove from heat and add couscous and stir to combine. Cover with foil and set aside for 5 minutes. Use a fork to fluff grains.
5. Place vegetables, chickpeas, couscous and mint in a bowl and toss to combine. Place on a serving platter. Drizzle with harissa to serve.
